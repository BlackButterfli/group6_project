# Output Description

This document provides detailed descriptions of the output statistics generated by the Pathogen Island Detection Toolkit.

## BLASTP Results

The toolkit uses BLASTP to align protein sequences and detect the presence of specific genes in new *Yersinia* strains. The key output statistics include:

1. **E-value**:
   - The E-value represents the number of alignments expected by chance. A lower E-value indicates a more significant match. Typically, an E-value less than 0.05 is considered a good indicator of potential homology.

2. **Bit Score**:
   - The bit score provides a normalized score for the alignment, reflecting the sequence similarity. Higher bit scores indicate better alignments.

3. **Alignment Length**:
   - The length of the aligned region between the query and the subject sequences.

4. **Number of Gaps**:
   - The number of gaps (insertions or deletions) in the alignment. Fewer gaps generally indicate a better alignment.

5. **Positive Substitutions**:
   - The number of conservative (similar) substitutions in the alignment. A higher number of positive substitutions suggests higher sequence similarity.

6. **Identities**:
   - The number of identical matches in the alignment. Higher identity percentages indicate greater sequence similarity.

## CSV and TXT Outputs

### CSV File

The CSV file provides a summary of the BLASTP results, including key metrics for each gene.
