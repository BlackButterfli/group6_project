# INTRODUCTION #  

This is a user-friendly program designed to perform various tasks related to gene analysis.
This all-in-one solution operates from a single file, utilizing a collection of Python functions stored in a separate script. No coding experience is necessary – just follow the straightforward installation process and instructions to unlock a range of tasks related to gene analysis effortlessly.  
When executing the program, you'll be greeted by an intuitive menu presenting the following options:  
  
**Check for 4 Genes in New Yersinia (Option 1):**
  * This option allows you to see how we extracted results (and extract yourself) about the four specific genes and if are present in new Yersinia.

**Check Any Protein In Fasta File (Option 2):** 
  * You can use this option to check any protein of your own in any FASTA file and have similar results like in option 1.

**Retrieve Sequence By Its ID (Option 3):**
  * You can retrieve a sequence based on its ID from a specified FASTA file.

**Exit (Option 'end'):**
  * At any point you can type in "end" to go back to the main menu, or if you are in the main menu - enter ׳end׳ to exit the program.


# INSTALLATION #

**For mac users:** (windows users skip)

### Step 1: Download Program Folder  
  1. Download the folder "program_group6" and name it exactly "program_group6". Save where desired.
  2. Make sure you have 2 folders inside program_group6 folder: "code" and "data".
  3. Make sure you have 2 files inside code folder: "program_functions.py" and "run_program.sh".
  4. Make sure you have 2 files inside data folder: "NewYersinia1.faa" and "NewYersinia2.faa".

DO NOT CHANGE ANY NAMES OF FOLDER AND FILES, DO NOT MOVE ANY FOLDER OR FILE.

Personal note on this step: The reason the program is ordered specifically is to ensure both mac and windows can run it, and to make it a one click running program
(which means, everything you need is in the same code file, no need to maneuver between codes).
In fact, except from necessary installations, the user does not need to know or understand any coding. All the user has to do is follow easy instructions, such as "what is your file name". The program will do the rest behind the scenes.


### Step 2: Install Python
  
  If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website.   
  https://www.python.org/downloads/  
  During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."   
  Make sure to download the latest version of Python (Python 3 and above). 

### Step 3: Install Blast  

=== explanation about blast ===

  1. Go to page:   
  https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/  
  2. Right click on "ncbi-blast-2.15.0+-x64-macosx.tar.gz". If needed choose "Save link as…" from the popup menu and save where desired.
  3. After finishing downloading, press on "ncbi-blast-2.15.0+-x64-macosx.tar" and a folder named "ncbi-blast-2.15.0+" will be extracted.
  4. Change the folder name to exactly "blast" and move it to the folder "program_group6".

### Step 4: Open Terminal  
  In the Finder , open the /Applications/Utilities folder, then double-click Terminal.
  In a terminal, you simply type commands and press Enter to interact with a computer's operating system.
  We will use it to run the program.


### Step 5: Install EDirect  

  To install the EDirect software, open terminal (step 4) type one of the following and press Enter:  

  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/entrezdirect/install-edirect.sh)"  

  sh -c "$(wget -q https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/entrezdirect/install-edirect.sh -O -)"  
    
  Please allow 20 minutes for it to donwload.   
  It may then print an additional command asking for PATH environment variable in the user's configuration file. The editing instructions will look something like:    
   
  echo "export PATH=\$HOME/edirect:\$PATH" >> $HOME/.bash_profile    
  
  If so, press Enter.  

  Now you should get a message similar to: "Entrez Direct has been successfully downloaded and installed."  

### Step 6: Move EDirect To Program File  

  1. Open terminal (step 4).  
  2. Type in and press Enter:  
     cd  
  No messege should apear.  
  3. Now you will copy to path to where EDirect is saved.    
     Type in and press Enter:
       
     find . -type d -name "edirect" 2>/dev/null
       
  4. Copy and save for later the path you got from after the ./    
     Example: If you got: ./edirect -Copy: edirect  
  5. Now you will copy to path to your blast folder in program folder:    
     Type in and press Enter:
       
     find . -type d -name "blast" 2>/dev/null
       
     Notice your path will end with /program_group6/blast  
  6. Copy and save for later the path you got from after the ./  
     Example:  
     If you got: ./Desktop/bioinformatics/group_project/program_group6/blast  
     -Copy:        Desktop/bioinformatics/group_project/program_group6/blast    
  7. Type in and press Enter:
        
     mv (path from 4) (path from 6)
       
     For example, for me:  
     mv edirect Desktop/bioinformatics/group_project/program_group6/blast  
 
### Step 7: Install Required Libraries  
  1. Open terminal (step 4), type and press Enter:  
     cd  
  2. Type and press Enter:
       
     pip install biopython pandas    

### Step 8: Verify Installations  
  1. Go to blast folder inside program_group6 folder. Make sure you have inside a folder named "bin", with many files inside, and a folder named "edirect" (among others).  
    
  2. a. Open terminal (step 4), type and press Enter:  
        python3  
     b. Type each line, one by one, press enter after each line:  
  
        from Bio import Entrez  
        from Bio import SeqIO   
        from Bio.Blast import NCBIXML  
        import sys  
        import pandas as pd  
        import os   
  
     If there are no error messages, the libraries are successfully installed.  
  
# RUN PROGRAM #  

1. Open terminal (step 4), type and press Enter:  
   cd  
2. Type in and press Enter:
     
   find . -type d -name "code" 2>/dev/null  
     
   Again, Copy and save for later the path you got from after the ./  
   Notice your path will end with /program_group6/code  
   Example:  
   If you got: ./Desktop/bioinformatics/group_project/program_group6/code    
   -Copy:        Desktop/bioinformatics/group_project/program_group6/code
   
3. Type in and press Enter:
   
   cd (your path)
     
   Example:
   cd Desktop/bioinformatics/group_project/program_group6/code
4.  Type in and press Enter:  
    pwd  
    This command to the terminal checks where you are in your computer. You should get the same path from 2.  
    If not, start from 1 again.  
5. Type in and press Enter:   
   bash run_program.sh  
  
You will now be welcomed in the main menu.  

Tip: Save the  commands you entered from steps 1, 3 and 5.  
Next time, all you have to do is open terminal and do 1, 3, 5 to run the program.  
  
# USING THE PROGRAM (PIPELINE) #  

![PIPELINE](https://github.com/BlackButterfli/group6_project/assets/92859243/3d7f8c82-ec55-408a-8e00-0a0a01662385)


**HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM**  
Using the program is straightforward.  
After running it, all you have to do is choose one of the options of the main menu.  
If you will choose an option that does not exist, you will be asked to choose again.  
At this point, you can exit the program by entering "end".  

**HOW TO USE EACH OPTION:**  

**Check for 4 Genes in New Yersinia (Option 1)**   
After making sure you set the program right (step 1), and data folder contains the fasta files of Yersinia, you only have to choose this option.  
You will get the results we got from blast and used in our analysis report in 3 forms:
1. Results printed(shown) to your screen. 
2. A CSV as an overview, few elements for a quick glance.  
3. A TEXT file.
The CSV and TEXT files will be saved in foler "option1_results" insise "code" folder.    
After each use, move/delete the folder since another run will add to text (you will have a text files with the same results twice or more).   

  
**Check Any Protein In Fasta File (Option 2)**  
1. First you need to put your fasta file inside the folder "data" inside "code" folder.  
   The program will ask for the name of the file, and will ask again if the name provided does not exist.   
   At this point, you can go back to the main menu by entering "end".  
2. Then the program will ask for the protein ID you want to check in the fasta file.  
   It will use Entrez Direct to retrive its sequence, and if it did not find a match - it will let you know and ask again to enter ID.  
   At this point, you can go back to the main menu by entering "end".  
3. You will get the same results as in option 1, saved in foler "option2_results" inside "code" folder.   
   After each use, move/delete the folder since another run will add to text and overwrite csv.  

personal note: All unnecessary files created from any step are automatically deleted.

**Retrieve Sequence By Its ID (Option 3)**   
1. First you need to put your fasta file inside the folder "data" inside "code" folder.  
   The program will ask for the name of the file, and will ask again if the name provided does not exist.   
   At this point, you can go back to the main menu by entering "end".
2. Then the program will ask for the protein ID you want to retrieve its sequence from the fasta file.
   The ID does not have to be case sensitive.  
   At this point, you can go back to the main menu by entering "end".
3. If the ID exists you will get its sequence, if not, you will be asked for an ID again.

  
### Important Notes - MUST READ 

How to use FASTA files in the program: 
1. Always store protein sequence FASTA files in the designated "data" folder insidie "program_group6" folder. 
2. Ensure that your FASTA files have proper extensions such as ".fasta" or ".faa". 
3. When entering the name of the file to the program, include the extension.
4. Avoid using the same filename for multiple files to prevent conflicts.

Remove results folders after each use:  
  
When you use option 1 or option 2, your results would be created in a folder inside "code" folder.   
You must move the results folder with all its content from "code" folder after everytime you get results.  
If you dont, the next time you try and have results, they will be added to previous results and/or rewrtie the previous results.
